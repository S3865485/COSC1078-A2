        <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The password manager application allows you to store all of your login details while ensuring that your information is kept in a safe and secure manner. This project stems from two main reasons; the first being the importance of cyber security and secondly to assist the many internet and technology users that tend to be forgetful.
            <br><br>
            This application makes use of multiple features including 2FA, reminder feature, password generator, notes and a “lock” feature. It will be hosted on a AWS website using but not limited to Java, HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. In addition to this, well known platforms such as Github, MS Teams and Trello will be necessary for the group to collaborate together on the project. These platforms are mainly to be used for communication and the project itself.
            </p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>Having a password manager can be useful for anyone that uses the internet/technology, which in this day consists of a majority of the population; approximately 59% of the global population (J. Clement 2020). Furthermore, a large portion of the population already use a system to record their passwords, as shown in HYPR’s 2019 study that resulted in 65% of their respondents using an app, digital or physical list of passwords for their personal life. This password manager application aims to aid users in organising, managing and creating their account details whilst also protecting their data.
            <br><br>
            It is especially useful for older users as well as those who tend to be forgetful. In a study, it was found that 78% of people ‘had to reset the passwords for one personal account in the last 90 days of their calendars’ (Daniyal Malik 2019, para 3). 
            <br><br>
            Australia has been ranked the 5th highest country in the world, in terms of exposed records (Adam Rippon 2019). Securing your sensitive information well involves the use of 2 Factor Authentication (2FA), strong/secure passwords and changing/updating your password on a regular basis.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, the password manager will suggest new passwords that assists users who often use the same password multiple times to reduce their chances of forgetting it. In a study, it was found that 72% of participants reused passwords for their personal accounts as they found it easier to remember one password over multiple. 
            <br><br>
            If the users choose to use a password manager they can better secure their accounts as the password manager will remember all of their passwords for them and save them time trying to remember it or reset it when they’ve forgotten it.
            </p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The password manager will allow users to track their accounts and passwords while also providing extra security to protect their data and information. Users create an initial account using their email address and chosen password which grants them access to the password manager’s features. From there, they can add multiple accounts for different websites and applications as well as organise them under categories/folders. Users can edit and manage their details as desired.
                <br><br>
            Users also have the option of adding notes along with their account details which can let them add additional information to the account login details as well as in a separate note taking section of the application.
                <br><br>
            It will incorporate a Two-Factor authorisation service where users can choose from a few options. The first option is a one time password (OTP) via SMS text message. The OTP is valid for a single login session, for a limited amount of time. Users may also choose a biometric authentication option of face or fingerprint recognition. The other options allow the user to either choose a 6 digit PIN or 3 secret questions and input an answer for them.
                <br><br>
            Alongside the 2FA feature will be a reminder alarm feature that notifies users to change their passwords every so often. At default, the feature will be set to remind the user every month to ensure the account is secure and to prevent others from accessing their precious data.
                <br><br>
            The application will also suggest new passwords for users through a password generator. The generator will randomly produce a password using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. It will have a minimum of 8 characters which is typically the recommended amount of characters to have in a password for it to be considered secure.
                <br><br>
            An additional feature that users may choose to enable or disable is the ability to “lock” certain account details, essentially hiding it from view and protecting it with a chosen PIN or password. This is useful if a user has specific account details that they wanted to protect further, such as bank account details or other sensitive information. Instead of users viewing their login details upon clicking, they will need to input a PIN/password beforehand which is aimed to increase the secureness of the system.
                <br><br>
            The OAIC has reported that 62% of data breaches have originated from malicious or criminal attacks (Office of the Australian Information Commissioner 2019). All of these features that our system will include assist in the prevention of data breaches and theft of confidential information.
            </p>
        <h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
            <p>To complete the project we need to use Atom.io to write and edit the code for the project. It is good to learn the tools because they will help us a lot with the project and in the future if we ever need to use them. GitHub is also an important tool for us to make this project possible. By using HTML we can create and design a website that we want. Atom.io is a good tool for editing HTML and it’s really easy to use. Each member of the team will obviously need their own computer or laptop otherwise the project cannot be worked on. Amazon Web Services (AWS) may also be used to host the website.
            <br><br>
            GitHub is a great tool for setting up an online website however, it requires time to learn and become familiar with. For GitHub to be used we must design or come up with an idea of how the website will look as this will help us during the development stage. This can be challenging for some members of the group as they may not be very creative. Our group must discuss how we want our project website to look and develop a plan for it.
            <br><br>
            We may use software such as Figma for the initial UI designs/framework. This allows us to have a better idea of what the password manager will look like and will serve as a framework to follow when actually creating the application’s interface with HTML and CSS.
            <br><br>
            To aid with team collaboration, the use of Trello will help to organise this project into boards showing who has been assigned to what task and when something is being worked on. Microsoft Teams is another tool that will enable the whole team to communicate with each other, either by voice, video or through typing. All these tools play a vital role in the development process of the project to ensure everything runs seamlessly. 
            </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>The skills required for this project revolve around the implementation of programming languages including but not limited to Java, HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. The latter four languages will be useful for the website implementation.
            <br><br>
            Being able to design and create an appropriate user interface to achieve the best possible user experience would also be another desirable skill to have for this project. Having the best and most efficient design would result in a more effortless navigation for the client. A good interface would also ensure that the learnability and memorability of the program is suitable for their needs. Additionally, the design must look adequate for the modern era, as well as not being too complex for beginner users while also being non intrusive for more experienced users.
            <br><br>
            The project may be feasible if all members have been exposed to the languages/skills mentioned above and are capable of being able to use and apply them accordingly. If one or two members are not experienced, it is possible to learn these skills and seek help with the basic aspects as long as the other members are quite proficient. However, it is ideal for everyone to have knowledge in this area for a more productive and profitable result.
            </p>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>If this project is successful, users will be able to create an account, save their login details and start saving passwords for different applications they use. It will allow them to manage and organise passwords for multiple accounts. All that the users need to remember is their account details for the password manager while the application worries about the rest. Essentially, it will help to solve the problem of having to remember multiple passwords for various websites/applications as well as provide further security over the user’s data with 2FA and other security features. Additionally, the project will also increase security of user accounts as the users can easily change all of their passwords through a central system that is secured through two factor authentication and other security options. The development of this project will raise awareness of cyber security and promote investigation into how user information can be further protected.</p>
