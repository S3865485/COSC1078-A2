        <h3>Group Reflection</h3>
        
        <h4>Sweta</h4>
        <p>I found that our team worked really well together as we all had great strengths from different backgrounds. For example, because I am from a Marketing background I was good at getting the team to interact and communicate with each other. Whereas everyone else such as Taneshwar, Minh, Kim, Sing and Nick were good at listening and being cooperative. We could have improved in time management because everyone had other assignments; it was a little more difficult to find a time where we could hold our team meetings. 
        <br>
        <br>
        One thing that was surprising is how well people can work together when they have the same goal; we determined at the beginning we wanted to get a HD for this assignment so we all are working towards that. One thing that I learned about groups is that communication is the key to making a team work. Without that, you aren’t able to do anything. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>Taneshwar</h4>
        <p>Everything went smoothly, everyone did the tasks that were assigned to them and tasks were allocated appropriately to allow every person to be able to complete their tasks. The group worked well together and was able to communicate fairly well. However the communication could have been improved as not everyone was very active in the Microsoft teams chat and did not really communicate that they had viewed the messages relating to them. Also, our time management overall could have been improved as not all tasks were completed in the time frame that was assigned to them. I was expecting some people to not show up to meetings as it was online and that they might fall behind however everyone in our group attended all of the meetings and did pretty well. I’ve learnt that working in groups has its own pros and cons and is heavily dependent on your group members. If their goals align with yours, everything goes nice and smoothly. We used Brackets rather than GitHub for the website as we felt more comfortable with it.</p>
        
        <h4>Kimberley</h4>
        <p> 
        I would say overall, we worked really well as a group and we started progress with the assignment well before the due date. I think our time could be managed a bit better however this is a bit hard as everyone has other priorities that need to be taken care of. I also found it surprising that all of our team members were willing to contribute and pull their own weight as I’ve had members from previous groups not putting in the effort or even communicating with the group. All of our members have also been able to attend the meetings we scheduled and communicated with one another through Microsoft Teams. Even with an additional member of the group joining a bit later than when the group was first organised, we were able to delegate tasks and start working on the assignment. I have learnt that it’s important to communicate with your group members and that it’s easier when you are working towards the same end objective.   
        </p>
        
        <h4>Sing Ho</h4>
        <p>
        We were all able to complete our tasks in a given time frame, and delegating the different roles for each of us was done fairly well. It allowed our project to be completed more efficiently. Something we could improve on would be communication, in my opinion, because I felt that we could have worked more closely together on this. I think we could have collaborated more with each other to ensure that no mistakes were made in our own sections of the project; we might have weaknesses in some areas or we could have made a mistake and missed it. However, this was difficult due to the current situation of us having to do everything online, rather than face to face. Time management was also a bit of a struggle because everyone has their own priorities outside of this project.
        <br><br>
        Something surprising to me was everyone being able to work together with basically no issues. I kind of expected there to be some disagreements, but that was not the case; everyone was friendly and we worked well together. Throughout this project, I learned that collaborating with others, in some aspects, is better than working alone because they could have strengths in your weaknesses.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Duc Nguyen</h4>
        <p>
        Our team worked really well together, everyone did an excellent job on their assigned tasks and jobs. Our communication is just perfect, we communicate efficiently and help each other to finish the part, if a member falls behind everyone trying to help to solve the problem and push the process . Everyone attended all the group meetings and discussed what to do next and steps to complete the assignment, I was really impressed with how we did it. From the beginning, everyone wanted a HD for this project and everyone worked together so hard to achieve the goal that we set for ourselves at the beginning. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>Nicholas</h4>
        <p>
        Overall we worked very well together and followed a schedule we set for ourselves in order to complete the assignment on time, with a lot of leniency in any time constraints so we could avoid rushing anything. We could have improved by communicating our answers more together to avoid any obvious mistakes that may have not been obvious. One thing that was surprising is that our group was able to stay on the same page despite everyone having vastly different skills. One thing that I learnt was how vital communication is for group assignments in order to make sure there is a finished assignment on time.
