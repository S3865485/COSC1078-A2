        <h3><u>Cyber-security</u></h3>
        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
            <p>‘Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks’ (Cisco, para 1). Cyber threats, on the other hand, are intended to harm us and our devices through the means of cyberspace (Hugh Taylor, 2020). Currently, there are many cyber threats including malware, ransomware, phishing, trojans, man in the middle attacks, denial of service (DoS) or distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) and data breaches. These threats are sourced from a variety of places and contexts such as terrorists, spies, hackers, organised crime groups and business competitors for many different reasons. 
            <br><br>
            We need to learn how to protect against cyber threats due to the damage it can cause to both individuals and companies. It is encouraged that businesses and individuals update software and operating systems when available to benefit from the latest security patches. End user security involves cryptographic/encryption protocols that encrypt critical data to protect information during transit and to protect against loss or theft (Kaspersky 2020). Security software, as its name suggests, provides security over information and can defend systems against viruses. 
            <br><br>
            Cybersecurity relies on not only technology but the individuals themselves to protect systems and data from security breaches. This may involve using strong passwords and updating them on a regular basis, avoiding unsecure WiFi networks and not opening attachments or links from unknown/untrusted senders. In recent years, we’ve seen the use of two factor authentication being more prevalent. Two factor authentication is an extra layer of security; the first being your username and password and the second layer being something you know, something you have or something that is a part of you. Examples of this include choosing secret questions that only you know, a PIN, one time password (OTP) via SMS or face/voice/fingerprint recognition. Having this extra layer is vital as two-thirds of people use the same password for multiple sites (Ivana, 2016). This makes accessing data even easier for hackers once they have a password for one site. It is also important to educate individuals about cyber threats and using security programs.
            <br><br>
            We can expect to see improvements to and the introduction of new technologies to aid cybersecurity within the next few years. However, as technology develops, so will the threat of cybercrime. Hackers will become more sophisticated and will also determine the future of what cybersecurity will be (John Shin, 2019). Encryption technology should be developed further to protect data and information from new cyber threats. Biometrics will be widely introduced around the world in hopes to combat emerging threats (William Dixon, 2019). Cybersecurity is also expected to have a future where artificial intelligence (AI) will be developed to secure devices and systems.
            </p>
        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
            <p>It is very likely that cybercrime will continue to grow and new cyber threats will start to surface in the coming years. Everyone can be affected by cyber threats in the future and current times but with the increasing use of technology, it will become more likely that more people will experience some form of cybercrime. As a result of this, the need for cybersecurity jobs will increase. 
            <br><br>
            Jobs such as Security Analyst, Security Architect, Security Engineer, Security Software Developer, Cryptanalyst, Cryptographer and Security Consultant will still continue to exist as they will be necessary to ensure security over networks, devices, systems, etc. In the last six years, Burning Glass found that the number of cybersecurity job postings grew by 94% (David Leaser 2019). New technology may also be developed in the future to aid in the cybersecurity field and dealing with cyber threats however this could also in turn cause some jobs to become redundant.
            <br><br>
            A main target of cybercrime are businesses and companies that have hold over large volumes of personal data. As a result, companies will need to implement more effective security solutions to deal with breaches. This may involve hiring more professionals in the cybersecurity field such as “ethical hackers” to actively search for vulnerabilities in the company and assess the overall security.
            </p>
        <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
            <p>Both cybersecurity and cyber threats will affect me, my friends and family whether this be on an individual or organizational basis. Essentially, it will and if not, can affect everyone. Nowadays, the internet and technology have become an increasingly important part of everyday life. 
            <br><br>
            Along with the growth and increasing use of the internet, technology and devices, cyber threats will also evolve. This means that I will need to be more aware of new threats and learn how to avoid or deal with them. Friends and family members should also be aware of cybersecurity and threats, especially older people as they may not be as well versed in using technology. They will need to learn and use new technological developments that aren’t currently available or as widely available. Further measures in an attempt to counteract new cybercrimes will need to be taken. Rather than only using 2FA, three factor authentication may become necessary for protection. This means three layers for an account including something you know (password), something you have (OTP) and something that is a part of you (biometrics). 
            <br><br>
            As an IT student, this means more job opportunities will open up if I ever choose to go into the cybersecurity industry. It also means a shift in focus/higher importance of cybersecurity in the future working in IT companies. This could affect my decision and those around me in choosing a career.

        <h3><u>Natural Language processing and chatterbots</u></h3>
        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
            <p>Natural Language Processing, also known as NLP, is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to fruitfully process large amounts of natural language data (Phillips 2018). Therefore, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is concerned with how technology can meaningfully interpret and act on human language inputs. For example, NLP allows technology such as Amazon’s Alexa to understand what you’re saying and how to react to it. Without NLP, AI that requires language inputs is relatively useless.
            <br><br>
            Using Amazon’s Alexa as our main example, chatbots would be able to provide little to no value without Natural Language Processing (NLP). Essentially, NLP is what allows chatbots to understand and respond to messages appropriately. When you send a message with “Hello”, it is the NLP that lets the chatbot know that you’ve sent a standard greeting, which in turn allows the chatbot to leverage its AI capabilities to come up with a fitting response. In this case, the chatbot will likely respond with a return greeting.
            <br><br>
            In today’s world, the most common use for NLP and chatbots is through Alexa and Siri. Not only do they respond to written communication but also verbal. Whereas with chatbots, they have the ability to respond to greetings, basic questions and the ability to recognise they cannot answer the question and transfer it to a human chat assistant.
            <br><br>
            An example of what the future could look like for NLP besides the examples used for Alexa and Siri, is online forms. For many years, customers have complained and not liked the idea of filling out online forms if they have to return something. Businesses have obsessed over how to make their forms more straightforward and more pleasing to customers, but in all practicality, there is no such thing as a pleasant online form to fill out for some users. There are only forms that are more or less annoying than others. Looking ahead, natural language processing could develop to a point soon, where instead of having to enter countless blips of text manually, customers could simply speak and fill out the form using their voice (AlchemyLeads 2020).
            <br><br>
            Another idea that businesses have wanted is the capabilities of voice search on their web pages. A numerous number of people have become used to the idea of speaking into their phones and other devices when searching for something. Therefore, by supporting voice search on web pages could be really beneficial for businesses and it’ll allow them to have a competitor advantage amongst others and have the ability to capture more customers.
            <br><br>
            Machine learning is one of the main technologies that must be adopted to achieve these desires. The concept of machine learning refers to the use of algorithms that are designed to keep improving themselves automatically continuously (AlchemyLeads 2020). Machine learning empowers chatbots to become smarter, more productive, more efficient, and more capable of satisfying customers.
            </p>
        <h4><u>What is the likely impact?</u></h4>
            <p>There are many positives and negatives that could come from these new developments. For example, for the online form it will ease access and time for customers filling out tireless forms and remove that pain point. It will allow businesses to have that leisure of having satisfied customers and allow them to engage with them more frequently as it is so easily accessible. This online form development won’t affect many jobs because it just requires the customer to fill it out whether it is by typing or verbal.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, the voice search development may have impacts on some jobs. For example, the customer service department team of a company may decrease due to the chatbots and NLP that allows customers to reach their desired information. However, it will allow customers to get what they need without it being time consuming and easily accessible which will allow a higher percentage of satisfied customers.
            <br><br>
            There will be changes in businesses with more technological advances (machine learning) therefore more money going into the business rather than labour and other liabilities. There also may be a change in structures of businesses if there are jobs being lost.
            </p>
        <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
            <p>This will affect me in a positive way because I am just like any other customer and want the easiest, most accessible and less time-consuming service when choosing to purchase/return or search something. It will affect my friends in the same way however older for family members it may not be as accessible. For example, my mum isn’t very tech-savvy and chooses to have things hand-written and this may not be the best solution for her. However, there can always be trial and error to get the best possible solution for people of all ages and technology backgrounds. </p>
        
        
        <h3><u>Robots</u></h3>
        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
            <p>A robot is a machine, one that is typically programmable by a computer to perform certain tasks set out by it’s programmer. They are able to complete complex assignments automatically, which can be achieved either by a controller or a preprogrammed set of actions coded into the device beforehand. While robotics are mainly concerned with trying to create/design intelligent machines that would be beneficial to our daily lives, and be able to assist us.
            <br><br>
            Robots are commonly designed to perform tasks usually managed by or unable to be completed by humans or to perform repetitive, mundane assignments. Typical examples of this would be in the secondary sector of the economy, robots would be used to mass produce products such as machines or cars. They could also be used for a more delicate purpose such as during surgery for a patient in which the robot is used for a precise and accurate operation. Another example would be the use of robots in toxic or hazardous environments  unfit for humans to perform in, such as in the military, where they can be used for disarming potential threats.
            <br><br>
            Currently robotics is being used in various ways for different tasks such as for medical purposes, military use, mundane tasks, etc. As of right now, we are able to use robots to perform labour intensive assignments, social needs, and much more; labour tasks might include space exploration, such as rovers being sent to Mars to collect samples or robots being sent to space for repairs to satellites. While social robots are being used for human interactions, they are designed to be human-like and to take on a humanoid personality, which can be used in a variety of areas such as training medical students. The technology is ever growing and is advancing quickly. Artificial intelligence is something rapidly growing alongside it as well, with the two being combined with each other we will soon be able to complete our duties more efficiently with fewer errors.
            <br><br>
            It is likely that in the next couple of years, robotics will become more advanced to the point that they will take on a more humanoid appearance, with their interactions between humans becoming and feeling more real due to the development of facial expressions and sensory abilities. There are also other advancements in different areas for robotics but this alone will create an impact in our daily lives. Artificial intelligence and its growing advancements makes this possible and reachable in just a couple of years.
            </p>
        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
            <p>The impact of robotics advancing will increase productivity for companies but create less jobs for people in the future. It has already started, with robots taking over certain manufacturing processes for companies or even having them perform deliveries for people. As of right now, these are only mundane tasks being taken over, meaning robots can’t take over teachers, scientists, or jobs that have more advanced requirements. The potential impact this has would mean millions of individuals will become unemployed very quickly in the near future, so jobs and tasks will have to change for those being replaced by machines. They can either be reassigned to something different or they would have to find something else to do if all potential jobs have been taken over for them. Currently those working in the primary sector and even secondary sector of the economy will be impacted the most by this, with automation and productivity being highly desired by companies to increase their profits, machines would eventually take over their jobs. This would include things such as the collection of crops, mining, the production process, etc. The tertiary sector is also being affected, but not as greatly. While the quaternary sector might, eventually, have the most job creating opportunities for people, as this sector is mostly knowledge based. Programmers and individuals required to maintain these machines will also be needed, thus creating more job opportunities for others. Programmers would be required to program the robots to perform the desired assignment for a certain task, this might be a highly sought after job in the near future. However, with the increasing number of unemployment amongst people being created by robots it could, potentially, lead to conflict or tension between the two sides. </p>
        <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
            <p>This would potentially make jobs more competitive and harder to find in the future. However, with the advancements of robots, such as artificial intelligence within cars or a more interactive and humanoid piece of technology, our lives would be more efficient and tasks could be completed with more ease. Self driving cars would eventually create less accidents and a more humanoid robot would allow for an easier and more user friendly interaction between us when performing certain tasks. For me, personally, the thing that will be different is my interaction with technology would change, service robots or cleaning robots are commonly used in homes and with the developments of artificial intelligence, sensors, and other functions our daily lives and constant interaction with these devices would be affected due to their growth.
            <br><br>
            Jobs and their availability will decrease and become more competitive as well, making it more challenging to acquire and maintain. Since machinery is taking over jobs, more highly skilled individuals will be sought after to look over these assets for companies, programmers or engineers, for instance, would be needed to use them properly. This creates opportunity, but since it requires a specific set of skills, the market for potential hires will decrease. Employers would usually want those most qualified and those that are the best to ensure that their investments will bring them the most profit, this means the competitiveness of jobs will increase even more.
	        <br><br>
            Family and friends would also be affected the same way, with their interactions with these devices changing, which can either be good or bad. As well as jobs being more difficult to obtain in the future.
