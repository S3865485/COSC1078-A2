        <h3>Interview results</h3>
        <h4>What kind of work is done by you (the IT Professional)?</h4>
        <p>I'm an Analyst Programmer. The position is composed of two roles but the majority of my duty is mainly on the programming side, developing new codes and fixing bugs. I do some analysis and that is when I collaborate with the product manager when required to assist in analysis and design of the system requirement. Sometimes I assist the support team with issue analysis and from time to time, I am asked to do database administration.
        <br>
        We follow the traditional Software Development Cycle where work or a requirement starts from either a client request or client raised issue.  Client requests are in the form of either an enhancement or a modification to the application.  These are handled by Product Management.  Whereas client raised issues are bugs or functionality that is not working as expected and these are handled by the Support Team.  A client request is analysed and specification written up.  A client raised Issue is analysed by the support team where issues are reproduced and identified.
        <br>
        Application Development follows when a request is to proceed or an Issue is identified and approved to go ahead. Once I'm done with the development, I do unit testing before they are handed over to the testers team. The testers team conduct a thorough testing on the actual change and a regression testing to ensure existing functionality is not adversely impacted by the change.
        </p>
        <h4>What kind of people do you interact with as an Analyst Programmer?</h4>
        <p>I am part of an IT team supporting a Software Application System made for the Building and hardware Industry. The entire IT Team consists of four main groups. Product Management, Support Team, Application Development and Testers. I belong to the Application Development team.  We basically only interact within these teams under the IT Group. I don't deal with Clients unless it's absolutely necessary like getting more information on an issue.  
        <br>
        Once in a while I attend User Group meetings.  This is a regular meeting that is attended by representatives of each client that we support. They go through the issues and enhancements to the software and decide the priority of these tasks.  As a programmer, this allows me to have an insight as to how the users utilise the system and get an in-depth understanding on how they see and value the Application to their day to day task in the operation of their respective company.
        </p>
        <h4>Where do you spend most of your time?</h4>
        <p>I spend most of my time in the office but with Covid-19 restriction I am working from home all the time. We have a regular daily team meeting to discuss the tasks and how we are progressing with each of them and a fortnightly meeting with the company. These are all done via Zoom.
        </p>
        <h4>What aspect of your position is most challenging?</h4>
        <p>The most challenging aspect of my position is fixing bugs. Finding the problem can be a real quick process or it can frustratingly take a long time but once the issue is found and a fix is implemented it is very satisfying.</p>
